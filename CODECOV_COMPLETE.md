## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### Codecov Settings
```yaml
coverage:
  status:
    project:
      target: auto
      threshold: 1%
    patch:
      target: 80%
      threshold: 5%
```

### Pytest Coverage
```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
branch = true
parallel = true
fail_under = 60

[tool.coverage.report]
precision = 2
skip_empty = true
show_missing = true
```

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
    flags: unit-tests
    fail_ci_if_error: true
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Repository Setup
1. **Add Codecov Token to GitHub Secrets**
   - Go to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/)
   - Sign in and add the repository
   - Copy the upload token
   - Add to GitHub Secrets as `CODECOV_TOKEN`

2. **Update README Badge Token**
   - Get badge token from Codecov dashboard
   - Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` in README.md

3. **Trigger CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Push a commit or create a PR
   - Verify coverage uploads to Codecov
   - Check Codecov dashboard for reports

### For Development
1. **Install Dev Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev,all]"
   ```

2. **Run Tests with Coverage**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --cov=src/llm2slm --cov-report=html --cov-branch
   start htmlcov/index.html
   ```

3. **Aim for 80%+ Coverage**
   - Write tests for new code
   - Cover edge cases and error paths
   - Use parametrize for multiple test cases

## 🏆 Achievements

✅ **Coverage Tracking** - Comprehensive metrics across all code  
✅ **Quality Gates** - Automated enforcement of standards  
✅ **PR Integration** - Automatic coverage comments  
✅ **Multiple Reports** - XML, HTML, JSON, Terminal  
✅ **Branch Coverage** - More accurate than line coverage  
✅ **Documentation** - Complete guides for setup and usage  
✅ **Badges** - Visual indicators of code quality  
✅ **CI/CD Enhanced** - Dedicated coverage job

## 💡 Tips for Contributors

### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [
    ("test", "TEST"),
    ("", ""),
    ("123", "123"),
])
def test_uppercase(input, expected):
    assert uppercase(input) == expected
```

### Checking Coverage
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/llm2slm --cov-report=term-missing

# Check specific module
pytest tests/test_privacy.py --cov=src/llm2slm/privacy

# Generate HTML report
pytest tests/ --cov=src/llm2slm --cov-report=html
```

### Coverage Goals
- 🎯 **60%**: Minimum (enforced)
- 🎯 **80%**: Target for production
- 🎯 **90%+**: Excellent coverage
- 🎯 **New code**: 80% minimum

## 🎉 Summary

The LLM2SLM project now has **enterprise-grade code coverage tracking** with:

- Comprehensive Codecov integration
- Automated PR comments and coverage diff
- Multiple report formats for different use cases
- Quality gates enforcing minimum standards
- Detailed documentation for maintainers and contributors
