## 🛠️ Local Development

### Running Tests with Coverage

```bash
# Basic coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/llm2slm --cov-report=term-missing

# Comprehensive with branch coverage
pytest tests/ \
  --cov=src/llm2slm \
  --cov-report=xml \
  --cov-report=html \
  --cov-branch \
  -v

# With coverage threshold
pytest tests/ --cov=src/llm2slm --cov-fail-under=60
